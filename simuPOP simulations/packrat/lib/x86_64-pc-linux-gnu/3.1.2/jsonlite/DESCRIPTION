Description: A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical
    data and the web. Started out as a fork of RJSONIO, but has been
    completely rewritten in recent versions. The package offers
    flexible, robust, high performance tools for working with JSON in R
    and is particularly powerful for building pipelines and interacting
    with web APIs. The implementation is based on the mapping described
    in the vignette of the package (Ooms, 2014). In addition to drop-in
    replacements for toJSON and fromJSON, jsonlite contains functions
    to stream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests
    included with the package verify that all edge cases are encoded
    and decoded consistently for use with dynamic data in systems and
    applications.
